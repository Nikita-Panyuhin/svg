## About

This is a repository of my artwork that I made while studying vector graphics and 3D modeling

**[3D modeling](./3D "Vector graphics: SVG images")**

You can use everything in this repository in your projects, works, etc. within the confines of the license.



### 3D modeling

I use [BES](http://mion.faireal.net/BES "Visit mion.faireal.net/BES") for all long-term renders. It slows down rendering, reducing load on the CPU, which is critical for me.

##### Some technical information

- I am using [Blender](https://blender.org "Visit blender.org") for modeling 3D scenes and animations.
- Blender files are built with **Blender** **`2.90`** - **`2.91`**



### Vector graphics

For vector graphics, the templates were taken from the Internet, but I drew all the vector images myself.

Each SVG image has a colored or/and black-and-white version. You can download:

- Beautified colored/black-and-white version
- Compressed colored/black-and-white version
- *Adobe Illustrator* source files

Links are located at the bottom of each page.

##### Some technical information

- I am using [*Adobe Illustrator*](https://adobe.com/ru/products/illustrator.html "Visit adobe.com/illustrator") for drawing vector images.
- *Adobe Illustrator* files are built with *Illustrator CC* and are compatible with *Illustrator 17* and later versions.
- SVG files are exported from Adobe Illustrator and then partly minified and beautified to fit some standards, as I see it.
- PNG files are rendered using the [*convert-svg-to-png*](https://github.com/neocotic/convert-svg/tree/master/packages/convert-svg-to-png "Node.js: convert-svg-to-png by neocotic") Node.js package by [neocotic](https://github.com/neocotic "Github user: neocotic"). Render sizes are specified for each image in `SVG/{image_name}/src/conf.json`
- The size of any SVG image is calculated without considering the size of the XML header (`-40 bytes`). SVG version is removed for compressed files (`-14 bytes`).
